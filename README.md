# Optimization in Routing Using Genetic Algorithm

There is a robot here that wants to make its way to its objective. In addition, the robot encounters several obstacles along the journey. The robot must find its way to the target while avoiding obstacles and traversing the smallest distance possible.

The algorithm generates barriers with a random form, but the starting and ending places are fixed. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to determine the shortest route.
